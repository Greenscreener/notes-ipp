	- people would have to study useful things
	- less people studying without an interest
	- teachers' salaries might be higher
	- more money in state budget
	- more money can be used for research
	- less money wasted
- tuition cons
	- it would discriminate low income students
	- it would cause student debt
	- some fields of study would be underfunded
	- changing one's field of study would be harder
- sentences
	- If there are tuition fees, people would be encouraged to pick more useful degrees, and there would be less people studying without an interest.
	- Provided that the fees result in an increased budget, the teachers' salaries might get higher, thus the quality of teaching might increase.
	- Also, more money could be used for the research.
	- However, the fees would discriminate against low income students as they would have to take out student loans.
	- As long as there are fees, some fields of study might be underfunded.
	- Furthermore, changing one's field of study would be less desirable, because they have already paid a lot of money for their current degree.
	- Therefore, we do not recommend instituting the tuition fees.
